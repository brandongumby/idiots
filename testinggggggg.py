specific god count and people blind choose which god (variable hp depending on team size)

god mythical greek roman theme

drops/broadcasts are a sacrifice to different gods and they gain power
teams need to compete to pass the admin teams static power (admin team praise a god or fill a bar to weaken the gods)

when a team gets a broadcast ingame they take a screenshot and post it, drops value determines how much gained power

thats the idea im going for, ideally id like to know what the admin team can do that makes sense on theme and maybe if theres anything else i should add
